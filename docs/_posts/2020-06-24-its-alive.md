One of today's major goals was to get a character moving on the screen with some
animations, and we are proud to say that this goal was achieved!

We had a, let's say, rocky beginning... our color palette and tile offsets were
initially all wrong. That made for some pretty funny glitches:
 
<img src="/gboi-kirby/assets/babysteps1.gif" height="300" />


But eventually, these rough edges were smoothened out and we got a decent
result (emulated under BGB):

<video autoplay height="300" controls>
  <source src="/gboi-kirby/assets/babysteps2.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

This was done using [this
project](https://github.com/flozz/gameboy-examples/tree/master/07-graphics4-sprites)
as a starting point (part of the C GB programming blog post series we mentioned in
earlier posts). However, it used 16x16 sprites and the way the animations were
encoded / handled didn't quite match what we wanted, so it had to be adapted.
But now, we finally have a basic ROM with an appropriate Makefile, so we can
start collaborating a little more effectively than we used to.

At this point, this still uses `gbdk-n`. Moving to `gdbk-2020` is high on our
list of priorities, since the latter is much more actively maintained. It also
offers support for bank switching; we're not sure yet whether we'll need it, but
that could come in quite handy at some point. We'll see.

I'd like to remark that writing code in C made it _much_ easier to iterate on
the animations. There was quite a bit of back-and-forth between myself and the
other members of the team for animating Piney, and I went with a slightly
different approach than what the base project used, with per-frame flip
information. Doing this in assembly language would have required more time for
the initial setup _and_ made it much harder to change things further down the
road, so I'm glad we were able to... _C the light_.
