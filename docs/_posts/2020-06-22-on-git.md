This post is intended to lay out the fundamentals of our workflow, the reasoning
behind it, as well as to provide a refresher on git fundamentals.


## Organizing code

Each team should be able to quickly iterate on the features it handles without
interfering with the others' work. To that end, **at least at first, we'll all
work on separate ROMs**. Obviously, everyone _needs_ to be able to compile and run
their code on their machine.

We want our code to be modular, so we'll **split up logically distinct parts of
the code into multiple files** and include them with the `.INCLUDE` (or its alias,
`.INC`) directive. While prototyping, each team will then include the relevant
files into the appropriate test ROM.


## Using git effectively

When working on a group project, effective collaboration is vital ; CodiMD and
Discord are pretty straightforward to use, but git deserves special attention.

First off, for _the very basics_, [this cheat
sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
should come in handy ; understanding and knowing its contents is an absolute
prerequisite.

Beyond that, core characteristics of our workflow are:
* `master` is sacred. Don't try to commit directly to it, nor to rewrite its
  history.
* When working on a feature, **always create a separate branch**.
* **Commit and push often** (but not to `master` ; you can't, anyway, because it is
  a protected branch).
* Use descriptive commit messages.
* **Do not commit binary files** unless absolutely necessary (one notable
  exception: tiles).
* When the feature you've been working on is ready to be merged into master, [**create a Pull
  Request (PR)**](https://github.com/PainsPerdus/gboi-kirby/compare). This will
  provide an opportunity for the rest of the team to review and discuss your
  changes.
* **Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PainsPerdus/gboi-kirby/issues)
  abundantly**. They are a great way to organize our work and are
  well-integrated with git. For example, if your work resolves a bug that was
  mentioned in, say, issue #24, you can write `fixes #24` in your commit
  message. The issue will be closed automatically (though not deleted!), and a
  reference to your commit will appear in it.



## Cheat sheet


### Creating a branch named `tile-colors` locally and checking it out
(i.e. switching to it):

```bash
git checkout -b tile-colors
```


### Staging changes and committing them
Local changes must typically be _staged_ before they can be committed. This is
done with `git add <path>`.

After doing so, and _before committing_, please review what you're about to
commit with `git status` (to see the affected files). If you want to inspect the
details of your staged changes, you can use `git diff --cached`. If you feel
you've made a mistake, [unstage as
needed](https://devconnected.com/how-to-unstage-files-on-git/).

Once you are satisfied with your staged changes, commit them with `git commit`,
which will open your text editor to let you write a commit message. Please write
a concise summary of your changes on the first line, add a blank line, then feel
free to go as much into details as you'd like in the rest of the commit.

Then, push your changes to your branch.


### Pushing your newly created branch to GitHub

The `-u` flag sets up a remote branch to track your local branch.
`origin` refers to a remote, namely our GitHub repository.

```bash
git push -u origin tile-colors # needed for the first push
git push # use this for subsequent pushes
```
