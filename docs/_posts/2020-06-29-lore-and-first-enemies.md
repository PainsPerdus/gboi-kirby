Let's make a little detour into the lore of Piney's world, and meet his first enemies!


## Lore

### Context

Piney is a little cute pineapple who struggles to fit in society due to his
psychopathic behavior. Always alone since his birth, his only joy is bloodshed,
which nobody seems to understand, for some reason... Poor little one... But we
promise, he is
trying his best!

One day, Piney decided to attack a research complex... Just for fun. As the
saying goes, kids will be kids! That day, he murdered every cute scientist fruit
on shift (they should have stayed home, if you ask me) in a glorious delight.
However, as Piney was trying to kill another scientist fruit, the latter pushed
a mysterious red button in an act of despair. What Piney didn't know was that it
was the button to activate a portal to an alternate dimension.

A Demonic dimension.

As soon the portal was open, monstrous demonic fruits started to emerge.

Now Piney is tired, he wants to go home, but he lost its way to the exit.
Well, too bad! Guess he'll just have to slay every being it encounters until he
finds a way out. Ferocious demonic fruits? Pff, if there is a monster here, it's
Piney. And don't worry, he _looooves_ hunting his prey...

_N.B.: yes, this is shamelessly inspired by Doom._

### In the game

The game starts with Piney murdering some random innocent fruit scientists
while they're working. This level is a tutorial for the player to learn how to
control little Piney and no fruit will defend itself. A pure bloodbath.

After a cutscene showing the demonic portal, the player is left right after the
first demon fruits appeared. Piney must find the exit, and for that, he will
pass through different rooms with various enemies that he will be more than
happy to get rid of.


## Enemies

### First enemy

We wanted a really basic first enemy, no bigger than 16x16 pixels. I struggled a
little to find a fruit that is recognizable enough and that I could modify so
that it looks like it was coming from hell. Also, I wanted to try to copy the
_Binding of Issac_'s enemy art style. And so, I came up with *Jaw Pear*:

It's a pear, with a jaw. Obvious isn't it?


## Some concept art

I have two pieces of concept art I'd like to post here.

The first one is little Piney with his sweet *Kindness* (the chainsaw). This
concept will help me design the title screen.

And the second one, which I would like to see as a boss someday: *Rayseye* or
*Reyesin*. I like the second one most because of the double pun: *raisin + eye*
and *-sin* (for a demonic fruit, I find it funny).
