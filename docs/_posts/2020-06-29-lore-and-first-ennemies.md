Let's make a little detour into the lore of Piney's world, and meet its first enemies !

?

## Lore

### Context

Piney is a little cute pineapple who struggles to fit in the society due to its psychopathic behavior. Always alone since its birth, its only joy is killing and massacre and nobody understand cute little Piney... Poor little one... But we promised, it is trying its best !

One day, Piney decided to attack a scientific basis... Just for fun you know, as the saying says "Kids will be kids". Anyway, it murdered every cute scientist fruits that were working today (they should have stayed home if you ask my oppinion) in a glorious delight. However, as Piney was trying to kill another cute scientist fruit, the latter push a mysterious red button as an act of despair. What Piney didn't know, it was the button to activate a portal to an other dimension.

A Demonic dimension.

As soon the portal was open, monstrous demonic fruits started to emerged. But Piney is tired, it wants to go home now... But it lost its track to the exist... Well, too bad, guess Piney just have to slay everyone and every monster until it finds the exit. Dangerous demon fruits ? Pff, if there is a monster here, it's Piney. And do not worry, it looooves hunting its prey.

### In the game

The game started with Piney murdering some random cute innocent scientist fruits during their work. This level is a tutorial for the player to learn how to control little Piney and no fruit will defend themselves. A pure bloodbath.

After a cinematic showing the demonic portal, the player is left right after the first demon fruits appeared. Piney must find the exit, and for that, it will pass through different rooms with different enemies it will be more than happy to get rid of.


## Enemies

### First enemy

We wanted a first enemy really basic and not biger than 16x16 pixel. I struggled a little to find a fruit enough recognisable and that I could modify so that it looks like it was coming from hell. Also, I wanted to try to copy the _Binding of Issac_'s enemy art style. And so, I came with *Jaw Pear* :

It's a pear, with a jaw. Obvious isn't it ?


## Some concept art

I have two concept arts I'd like to post here. 

The first one, is little Piney with its sweet *Kindness*. This concept will help me to design the title screen.

And the second one, I'd like to see this enemy as a boss one day. It's name is *Rayseye* or *Reyesin* but I like the second one most because of the double pun : *raisin + eye* and *-sin* (for a demonic fruit, I find it funny).
