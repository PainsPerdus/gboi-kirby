Even if our project is based on _The Binding of Isaac_, we decided to make our
own graphics with our own little character. And it's time for me to make a
proper introduction.

## The main character: Pinkie

### First step

At first, when we started to talk about our project, team_kirby wanted to add
new ideas of gameplay, and we chose to take some from the game _Doom_. So we
wanted a character ready to murder anyone with blood and lots of violence. But
another idea was to have a cute character to enhance its violence and psychotic
behavior.

So we wanted something cute but murderous.

At first, we tried to make a character made of 8x8 pixels (to reduce the number 
of horizontal sprites) but we didn't manage to have both the **smile** (for the
psychotic part) and the **ears/horns/cute details** (for the cute part). Also,
we chose to make a 8x16 sprite to have both of those ideas. And so, after some
tries, we created Pinkie :

<img src="/gboi-kirby/assets/img/downwalk1.gif" width="150"  />


Pinkie is a pineapple. Pinkie is cute. Pinkie will murder everyone.

### Its weapon

So, right, Pinkie is cute. But we wanted him murderous with psychotic
tendencies. And the best way to show that was through its gameplay, and more
precisely, through its weapon and way of killing. And because _Doom_ was one of
our inspirations, we easily agreed to give our little Pinkie an oversized
chainsaw.

At first, it wasn't supposed to become this iconic, but as we talked about our
little cute murderous and psychotic pineapple, we decided to make it more
iconic. Here, a preliminary version of it in action:

<img src="/gboi-kirby/assets/img/chainsaw1.gif" width="150" />


### What more ?

For the time being, I'm focusing a lot on the chainsaw. It must be violent,
oversized, and I brainstorm a lot with [@yberreby](https://github.com/yberreby)
to know what to do with it.

Also, another game mechanic is yet to be implemented: the Dash. 

It's supposed to be a major part of the gameplay, also I need to offer Pinkie a
good dash animation so that the player have a good experience playing. 




## Maps and general estethics

I'm working with [@Chatpion](https://github.com/ChatPion) and
[@RoussyE](https://github.com/RoussyE) to create the graphics they need for the
maps (pikes, walls, holes...).

Because we want to make a violent game (with blood and explosions!) we will need
lots of sprites/tiles (we haven't decided how to make it yet) to make
visible all those information on screen. Also, I decided to have very simple
map graphics at first (not to saturate the visual information so that the player
can still manage to play despite the bloodshed).
